The effects of this negligence can be seen in many different industry trends in the United States, ranging from healthcare to economics.  The prominent examples of evidence of these trends are endless, recent examples include the realization that we need to rethink almost everything we know about human medicine due to [the latent influence of the microbiome](https://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/rise-of-microbiome), spending [more than most other developed nations on healthcare](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#item-start) with lackluster results, a [Nobel-winning Economist's call to end our reliance on GDP as the primary metric](https://www.fastcompany.com/90435788/a-nobel-winning-economist-says-its-time-to-kill-the-gdp).

These are just a few examples of recent memory.  But the importance of root cause analysis can be seen in all of them and has infinitely more applications.
